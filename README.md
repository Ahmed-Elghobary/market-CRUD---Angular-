# 🅰️ Angular Project

## 📝 Overview
This project is a single-page application (SPA) built with Angular. It demonstrates a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation using an external API. The project showcases my understanding of Angular modules, components, and directives.

## ✨ Features
- **📁 Modular Structure**: The project is organized into modules to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **📦 Components**: Various components are created to encapsulate different parts of the application, ensuring reusability and separation of concerns.
- **📐 Directives**: Custom directives are used to extend HTML functionality and enhance user interactions.
- **🌐 Routing**: The project uses Angular Router to navigate between different views.
- **🔄 CRUD Operations**: Full CRUD operations are implemented, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data from an external API.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Angular**: Framework used for building the SPA. ⚛️
- **TypeScript**: Programming language used for writing Angular code. 🔤
- **HTML & CSS**: Markup and styling of the application. 📝
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework used for responsive design. 🎨
- **External API**: Consumed for performing CRUD operations. 🌍

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed. 🔧
- Angular CLI installed. 🛠️

# Angular Project

## Project Structure 📂

- **`src/app/`**: Contains the main application modules and components.
  - **`components/`**: Contains all the components. 🛠️
  - **`services/`**: Contains services for making HTTP requests to the external API. 🌐
  - **`models/`**: Contains TypeScript interfaces for data models. 📝
  - **`modules/`**: Contains feature modules. 🗂️
  - **`directives/`**: Contains custom directives. ✨
  - **`app-routing.module.ts`**: Configures the application's routes. 🗺️

## CRUD Operations 🔄

### Create ➕ 

- **Description**: Allows users to add new data to the application. 🆕
- **Implementation**: The create component provides a form for entering new data. The form data is sent to the external API using an HTTP POST request. 🌐

### Read 📄

- **Description**: Fetches and displays data from the external API. 📜
- **Implementation**: The read component retrieves data from the API using an HTTP GET request and displays it in a list or table format. 🗒️

### Update ✏️

- **Description**: Allows users to update existing data. ✏️
- **Implementation**: The update component provides a form pre-filled with the existing data. The updated data is sent to the API using an HTTP PUT request. 🔄

### Delete ❌

- **Description**: Allows users to delete data from the application. 🗑️
- **Implementation**: The delete component provides a delete button for each data item. When clicked, it sends an HTTP DELETE request to the API to remove the item. 🗑️
